# Please follow the rules below:

1. Code the design in HTML and CSS (make sure to use Semantic HTML and proper attributes). We are open to you using a framework if you usually do to set up your code, feel free to proceed as you usually would.

2. Use either "Boilerplate HTML template" or another framework you are familiar with.

3. Build the page responsive (make the page fit well on mobile and desktop).

4. Use your imagination! Create some page animations and hover states for buttons that you think look nice/pretty.

5. You must code your own javascript function which will automatically change the slide every 4 seconds.

6. Zip your finished folder and send it via email back to us or use a repository and share that with us.
